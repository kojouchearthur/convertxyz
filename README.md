# multiconverter-multiform
convert values between different units from separate forms. This is a major update on my earlier multi-converter project. It is based purely on Javascript...

#Update
The major updates from the earlier single form multi-converter project include:
- Number base conversion (between binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal)
- Three separate forms each for a group of units
- Javascript code cleaner and more efficient, including use of function closures.

# Online Demo
